    /// You are guaranteed that one of the `name_acquired_handler` and `name_lost_handler` callbacks will be invoked after calling this function - there are three possible cases:
    /// `name_lost_handler` with a `NULL` connection (if a connection to the bus can't be made).
    /// `bus_acquired_handler` then `name_lost_handler` (if the name can't be obtained)
    /// `bus_acquired_handler` then `name_acquired_handler` (if the name was obtained).
    /// If the name is acquired or lost (for example another application could acquire the name if you allow replacement or the application currently owning the name exits), the handlers are also invoked. If the `GDBusConnection` that is used for attempting to own the name closes, then `name_lost_handler` is invoked since it is no longer possible for other processes to access the process.
    /// You cannot use `g_bus_own_name()` several times for the same name (unless interleaved with calls to `g_bus_unown_name()`) - only the first call will work.
    /// Another guarantee is that invocations of `name_acquired_handler` and `name_lost_handler` are guaranteed to alternate; that is, if `name_acquired_handler` is invoked then you are guaranteed that the next time one of the handlers is invoked, it will be `name_lost_handler`. The reverse is also true.
    /// If you plan on exporting objects (using e.g. `g_dbus_connection_register_object()`), note that it is generally too late to export the objects in `name_acquired_handler`. Instead, you can do this in `bus_acquired_handler` since you are guaranteed that this will run before `name` is requested from the bus.
